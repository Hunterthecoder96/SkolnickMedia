            <h1>We Start with Research and Analytics...</h1>
                 <p><span>WE RESEARCH THE CUSTOMER...</span>Research and analytics drive every marketing strategy we develop. We research the CUSTOMER FIRST! Discovering what drives your customer to purchase is the first step in learning how to communicate to them.</p>
                 <p><span>WE ANALIZE THE CURRENT MARKETING INITIATIVES...</span>we do a “marketing roundup” of your current marketing. What is your current marketing budget? What is your current strategy? Is your website delivering new customers? How do you get customers to visit your website? Is your website Point of Sale or a funnel to get the customer to call? What about print, radio & TV? How do you measure the effectiveness of each buy/placement?</p>
            <h1>We develop the improved strategy...</h1>
                <p>From our customer research and our analysis of your current marketing initiatives we develop an improved plan that incorporates what is necessary to reach YOUR customers. Not everyone needs TV or radio, not everyone needs direct mail. Our goal is not to get you to spend more, it’s to get you a better return on investment.</p>
            <h1>We execute the strategy with skill and focus...</h1>
            <p>Part of your market strategy is when and where to place your initiatives, their duration and their effectiveness. As we implement the plan, we look for ROI and make adjustments accordingly to ensure that your company is growing at a steady, healthy pace.</p>
            <h1>We keep you informed...</h1>
                <p>We provide reports and analyses that show the effectiveness of each marketing initiative. From these reports, we discuss changes that will improve the strategy and hence, the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.</p>
